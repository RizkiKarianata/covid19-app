## 💾 Requirements

* `Node.js` - used for the entire application development process. Whether it's making an API or something
* `Web Browser` - can be used as an emulator to build applications. Example [Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Opera]
* `Internet` - because many use CDN and to make it easier to find solutions to all problems
* `Composer` - make it easier for developers to manage PHP project dependencies
* `Android SDK` - to simplify the process of building applications
* `Gradle` - function to perform application building automatically
* `Java Development Kit` - used for support in developing or building an application

## 🎯 How To Use

#### Using the built-in ready to use from the release (Recommended)

Download the latest project release from the [Release Page](https://github.com/RizkiKarianata/covid19-app "Release Page"). Open the Covid-19 App project folder using a terminal and type `npm run dev`. To explore the source code you can use a text editor such as Visual Studio Code.

#### Build manually

* Before starting, make sure you have Node.js installed first
* If you have installed Node.js. Run the command git clone which is `https://github.com/RizkiKarianata/covid19-app`
* Install the dependencies using the node package manager of your choice. For example run `npm install` in terminal
* To run the application you can run the command `npm run dev`. And the application will automatically open using port 8080 on your default browser

#### Build to APK

* You can run commands like in the `NPM Scripts` below by adding `npm run`. Example `npm run build-dev-cordova-android` on terminal

## 🛠 NPM Scripts

## 🤝 Contributing

<p>I really appreciate contributions, issues and feature requests because this application is far from perfect. Feel free to Pull Request and make changes to this project.</p>
<p>Since this is an open source project I finished it myself. There may be many features or things that could be improved or added. So I really appreciate your help.</p>

#### Steps To Contribute

* Fork it ( https://github.com/RizkiKarianata/covid19-app )
* Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
* Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
* Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
* Create a new Pull Request

#### Notes To Contribute

Make sure to not commit generated files from your dist folder. All changes need to be made in the source files located in the `src` folder.

* Change the `scss` files to adapt styles
* Change the nunjucks based `html` files or the content defining `json` files to adapt layout and content
* Change the `js` files to adapt the application code

Always run a build and test the results before committing.
